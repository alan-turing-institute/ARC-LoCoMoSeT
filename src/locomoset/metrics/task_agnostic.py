Functions for the task-agnostic metrics. In particular the number of parameters of a
model as a metric.

This also includes functions for reweighting a set of metric values by the inclusion of
a task agnostic metric as a proxy for 'capactity to learn', as introduced in the
Pairwise Annotation Representation Comparison (PARC) metric for transferability paper:
